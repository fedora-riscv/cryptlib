Peter Gutmann has writen an excellent 374 page manual for Cryptlib.

This manual provides code examples in C, Java, Python and other
languages and detailed descriptions of the cryptlib security
architecture, including the explanation of its High-, Medium-
and Low-level interface. All information needed to add security
services to existing applications is easily accessible with this
manual.

The manual has a very liberal copyright notice, that allows commercial
use under the condition that the manual isn't distributed for a fee.


Unfortunately, due to this use restriction it cannot be included in 
the Fedora distribution.

But the good news is, that you can download this excellent manual as a
PDF file from Peter's web page.

http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/manual.pdf

If you refer to the numerous code examples, you will be able to use
cryptlib in your own (commercial) projects quite easily.

As the manual is part of the documentation that is required to mention
the contributions of other people to the source code of Cryptlib, I'll
quote the Acknowledgement in full here:
